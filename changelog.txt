v.0.9.4a
[Added] M569 code to turn on or off stepper motor direction inversion (use X, Y, Z, E, U, V letters for axes, e.g. "M569 X0 Y1" to turn off X-axis iversion and turn on Y-axis inversion)
[Added] Controlled motherboard cooling fans for Composer A4 v1.0.4+ and A3 v1.0.1+
[Changed] Buildplate in now not cooled on pause
[Changed] Minor changes on toolchange sequence to make it faster
[Fixed] Fixed material load/unload lengths on Composer A3 1.0.x
[Fixed] Fixed disabling z-axis motors and Z homing sequence for Composer A3 1.0.x

v.0.9.4
- Pause rework
- Prindhead movement is now available on pause
- Printhead heating/cooling is now available on pause
- Reinforcing fiber is now cut on print cancellation if needed
- New Debug Info screen with information about current position, tool, temperatures, fan speed, endstop status
- Minor changes in material loading/unloading sequence
- Fixed problem with "Print again" printing different file
- Fixed problem with buildplate heating after pause
- Fixed problem with with unexpected feeders movement after pause  

v.0.9.3
- Elapsed time and estimated time left is now displayed during printing
- Nozzle cooling fans can now be turned on/off from LCD (Maintenance - Movement - Extruders)
- Now toolchange on power on and from LCD screen is done without nozzle cleaning
- Print is now paused on temperature and heating errors
- Added new G-code to park/unpark printhead near wipe station (M1013 - park, M1013 R - return). This G-code will be used to park printhead for heating during printing to prevent plastic drops on the part.
- Toolchange sequence updated. "T<toolnum> Q" command performs quick toolchange without nozzle cleaning 
- Updated material load distances
- Minor changes in buildplate calibration wizard
- Some changes in pause and resume sequence
- Fixed problems with incorrect behavior after pause
- Fixed problem with thermal runaway error display on LCD
- Other minor fixes and improvements


v.0.9.2
- New firmware file format, fw2. Use Aura 0.9.13 or later to update firmware to this version.
- System config is now stored in EEPROM
- Added cut M-code (M1010)
- Added cut settings M-code (M1011 S<servo-id> A<cut-angle> B<neutral-angle>)
- Added toolswitch settings M-code (M217)
- Added filament load/unload settings M-code (M704)
- Added LCD brightness M-code (M250 C<brightness %>)
- Added preheat settings M-code (M145 H<hotend temp> B<bed temp>)
- Linear advance 1.5 added. The deafault k coefficient is set to zero, but can be set before the print with M900 command.
See http://marlinfw.org/docs/features/lin_advance.html for more details.
- Information about current printhead, buildplate and chamber temperatures is now displayed during printing
- Exhaust fan now turns on automatically if the chamber temperature sensor is present on printer and the chamber temperature is high (50°C)
- Print head throat cooling fans are now turned on only if extruder temperature is above 60°C
- Fixed bug with layer number not displaying after pause
- Other minor fixes and improvements
